When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on a project with other people, 
or working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
Having Git automatically synced could pull changes that 
you don't want automatically pulled in, or that you are still
working on.
