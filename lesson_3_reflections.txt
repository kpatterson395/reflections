When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on a project with other people, 
or working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
Having Git automatically synced could pull changes that 
you don't want automatically pulled in, or that you are still
working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones,
and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?
Forkes are only on Github, and you would use this 
to make your own changes to someone's code
without affecting their repository, while still
linking back.
Clones are a way to copy a repository locally and
can be used to work locally on a project you have
on Github.
Branches are a way to 'checkout' a current repository
and make changes that wouldn't affect a production version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?

This is helpful to know if you have made changes that 
are ahead of the remote copy, and also if changes
have been made to the remote copy that you need to
merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using git/github, you could use a file sharing 
system like google docs, or save documents to a location
accessible by all parties.
It would be simpler in someways to update changes,
however it would be very easy to lose code, or to 
break the current version of code.
